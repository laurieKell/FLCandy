\title{Calculate Prediction Skill Scores}
\usage{
skillScore(x, y, threshold = NULL, reference = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of model predictions (e.g., estimated stock biomass)}

\item{y}{Numeric vector of observed values (e.g., survey biomass index)}

\item{threshold}{Optional numeric vector of decision thresholds for classification}

\item{reference}{Reference value for stock status classification (default = 1, typical BMSY threshold)}
}
\value{
Data.frame containing optimal threshold and associated metrics:
\itemize{
\item ref: Optimal reference threshold
\item TP: True positives at threshold
\item TN: True negatives at threshold
\item FP: False positives at threshold
\item FN: False negatives at threshold
\item TSS: True Skill Statistic (TPR - FPR)
\item TPR: True Positive Rate (sensitivity)
\item FPR: False Positive Rate (1 - specificity)
\item AUC: Area Under ROC Curve
}
}
\description{
Computes threshold-based skill scores including TSS (True Skill Statistic) and AUC (Area Under the Curve) for fishery stock assessment models.
}
\examples{
# Simulate stock assessment data
obs_status <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = log(1), sdlog = 0.5)
pred_status <- obs_status * exp(rnorm(100, sd = 0.3))
skillScore(pred_status, obs_status > 1, reference = 1)
}
