\title{Calculate Exploitable Biomass}
\usage{
ebiomass(object)

\S4method{ebiomass}{FLStock}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class FLStock}
}
\value{
An FLQuant object containing the exploitable biomass time series
}
\description{
Calculates the exploitable biomass from an FLStock object using selectivity-weighted
catch weights and stock numbers.
}
\details{
Exploitable biomass is based on weighting catch weights by selectivity normalised
by peak selectivity, then multiplying by stock numbers and summing across ages
